/*
INHERITANCE :- OVERVIEW
 - Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
 - In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
 - Reusing classes saves time and money
 - Reusing already tested and debugged class

INHERITANCE IN C++ :-
 - Reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
 - Reuse the properties of an existing class by inherititing from it
 - Existing class is called as the BASE CLASS
 - New class which is inherited is called as the DERIVED CLASS



TYPES OF INHERITANCE :-

 - SINGLE INHERITANCE: A derived class with only one Base class

 - MULTIPLE INHERITANCE: A derived class with more than one base class

 - HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE: Several derived class from single base class

 - MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE: Deriving a class from already derived class
        ANIMAL -> MAMMAL -> HUMAN

 - HYBRID INHERITANCE: Combination of MULTIPLE and MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE
